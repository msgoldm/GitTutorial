shell basics: ls, cd, mkdir, pwd

To add things: git add filename
		followed by git committ -m "comments in quotes"

when git commit returns long name, you can just refer to abbreviated unique name

	-may want branches
	-e.g. cuz you want to make a new analysis, without screwing up
		what people are doing with versions further down the tree
